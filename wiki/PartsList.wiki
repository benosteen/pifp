= Suppliers we have used =

 * Farnel Electronic Components - (not the cheapest, but having lots from one source): M8 threaded rod, M8 stainless steel rod, toothed belts, hex head screws, nuts, washers, etc. (((TODO: add parts list from order)))
 * An alternative source for M8 threaded rod, and some of the other hardware, is Screwfix. (Just don't search for "studding")
 * Zapp Automation (http://www.slidesandballscrews.com/) - stepper motors
 * Park Industrial Supplies (eBay supplier: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/ParkIndustrial-Supplies) - bearings.  Good deals for packs of 10-off 624, packs of 4-off 608.
 * A promising source for electronics and special parts: http://www.mendel-parts.com/.  (I've not used these yet, but I probably will when they have Gen6 electronics available.
